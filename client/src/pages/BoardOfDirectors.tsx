As the former principal of Dr. Kalmadi Shamrao High School in Pune, Maharashtra, she has spent her career nurturing young minds and advocating for quality education.\n\nDeeply aligned with the Bundele Foundation's mission, Sunita is highly motivated to make a lasting impact in the areas of children's education and senior care.

Her vital organs, including corneas and skin, will be donated to those in need, and the rest will support medical education and research. Her life and choices reflect the values of service, compassion, and lifelong learning that the Bundele Foundation proudly upholds."
