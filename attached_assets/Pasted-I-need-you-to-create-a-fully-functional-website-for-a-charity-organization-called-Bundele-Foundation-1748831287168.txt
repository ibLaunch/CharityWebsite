OUR IMPACT SINCE 2022
2022- Donated 12 pieces of furniture to Madhyamik Vidyalaya: Madhyamik Vidyalaya in Pune is a government-aided rural school. Until recently, students sat on the floor due to a lack of furniture, leading to discomfort and health issues. The donation has helped create a safer, cleaner, and more focused learning environment.
2022- Donated 10 dinning table chairs to Mahalunge Vidyalaya: Helped improve the school‚Äôs mealtime setting by providing students with a more comfortable and hygienic space to eat.
2023- The Painting Project at Nutan Balvikas Mandir, Pune: The classrooms hadn‚Äôt been painted in over 30 years. The Bundele Foundation donated ‚Çπ2 lakhs to help, along with Rotary Clubs and a CSR partner for Paints. The project focused on painting the classrooms first, then the outside walls.

Keep this website modern with solid colors.‚ÄúI want to create a modern, clean, and minimal website with a light color palette (white, soft gray, mint, black accents). The layout should have large sections, bold typography, and plenty of whitespace for a calm, professional feel. Maybe geometric shapes or like cool website. 
Include high-quality visuals and clean icons. Use cards or boxes to neatly organize content like testimonials, updates, and images.
The site should feel like a digital landing page or portfolio with call-to-action buttons like 'Join WhatsApp Group', 'Donate Now', and 'Contact Us'. It should be scroll-based, with section dividers, smooth transitions, and easy navigation.

 I have attached some pictures that you can use. I have also added my past draft when I was creating the website. you can use my past template for inspiration of layout and information. You can edit the pictures so they look professional.
