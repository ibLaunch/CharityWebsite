# Foundation Website Color Enhancement Prompt

## Task
Enhance the existing Bundele Foundation website by improving the color scheme while maintaining its professional, trustworthy appearance.

## Current State
The website currently uses a conservative monochromatic color scheme with navy blue headers, white backgrounds, and gray text.

## Requested Changes

### 1. Add Accent Color
•⁠  ⁠Choose a warm, professional accent color (suggestions: muted gold #C5A572, sage green #9CAF88, or soft coral #E8A598)
•⁠  ⁠Apply this accent color to:
  - Call-to-action buttons ("Donate" and "Join Impact Circle")
  - Key statistics numbers in the challenges section
  - Hover states for interactive elements

### 2. Enhance Visual Hierarchy
•⁠  ⁠Add subtle background tints to different sections for better visual separation
•⁠  ⁠Use the accent color for section dividers or decorative elements
•⁠  ⁠Consider adding a very light tint (5-10% opacity of accent color) as section backgrounds

### 3. Improve Button Styling
•⁠  ⁠Make primary buttons (Donate, Join Impact Circle) stand out with the accent color
•⁠  ⁠Add hover effects with slightly darker shade of accent color
•⁠  ⁠Ensure good contrast ratios for accessibility (minimum 4.5:1)

### 4. Statistics Section Enhancement
•⁠  ⁠Make the large numbers (1 in 5, 42%, 36%, etc.) more prominent using the accent color
•⁠  ⁠Consider adding subtle background shapes or borders around each statistic

### 5. Maintain Professional Feel
•⁠  ⁠Keep the overall clean, minimalist design
•⁠  ⁠Ensure all color choices support readability
•⁠  ⁠Maintain the trustworthy, credible appearance

## Technical Requirements
•⁠  ⁠Ensure all colors meet WCAG accessibility standards
•⁠  ⁠Test on both light and dark backgrounds
•⁠  ⁠Maintain responsive design principles
•⁠  ⁠Use CSS custom properties for easy color theme management

## Deliverable
A refined version of the website that feels more engaging and visually interesting while preserving its professional foundation aesthetic.
